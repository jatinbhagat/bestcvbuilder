## Score Categories

- **90-100**: Excellent - Outstanding ATS compatibility
- **80-89**: Very Good - Minor improvements needed
- **70-79**: Good - Some optimization recommended
- **60-69**: Fair - Significant improvements needed
- **0-59**: Poor - Major optimization required

## Error Handling

### Error Types

1. **FileProcessingError (400)**: Invalid URL, file too large, download failed
2. **TextExtractionError (422)**: Cannot extract text from file
3. **ATSAnalysisError (500)**: Analysis processing error

### Example Error Response
```json

}
```

## Local Testing

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run local test
python api/cv-parser/index.py
```

## Deployment

The API is designed for Vercel serverless deployment with the following configuration in `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "functions": {
    "api/cv-parser/index.py": {
      "runtime": "python3.9",
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  }
}
```

## Technical Details

### Text Extraction Strategy
1. **PDF**: PyPDF2 for standard PDFs, pdfplumber for complex layouts
2. **DOCX**: python-docx for paragraphs and tables
3. **DOC**: docx2txt for legacy format support

### Industry Detection Algorithm
Uses weighted keyword frequency analysis across predefined industry categories. Falls back to 'general' if no clear industry match.

### Keyword Scoring
- Industry keywords: 2 points per occurrence (max 4 per keyword)
- Action verbs: 1-2 points per occurrence (max 2 per verb)
- Total keyword score capped at 30 points

### Quantified Achievement Patterns
- Percentages: `\b\d+%\b`
- Dollar amounts: `\$\d+[,\d]*(?:\.\d{2})?\b`
- Large numbers: `\b\d+[,\d]*\s*(?:million|thousand|billion|k)\b`
- Performance metrics: Context-aware pattern matching

## Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**: Text extraction libraries loaded only when needed
- **Efficient Regex**: Compiled patterns for repeated use
- **Memory Management**: Streaming file downloads, cleanup after processing
- **Timeout Handling**: 30-second timeout for file downloads

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: ML-based scoring refinement
2. **Job Description Matching**: Targeted analysis based on job requirements
3. **Multi-language Support**: International resume analysis
4. **Visual Layout Analysis**: Logo, formatting, and design assessment
5. **Real-time ATS Testing**: Integration with actual ATS systems

## Maintenance

### Updating Industry Keywords
Edit the `INDUSTRY_KEYWORDS` dictionary in the main module to add new industries or keywords.

### Adjusting Scoring Weights
Modify component score caps and weights in the respective analysis functions.

### Adding New File Formats
Implement new extraction functions and add to `extract_text_from_file()`.
